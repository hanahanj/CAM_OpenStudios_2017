Yuko Suga studied metalsmithing with Heikki Seppa at Washington University in St Louis, where she received an Intense Minor in Metals and a Master of Science degree in Occupational Therapy. She is involved in community-based programs as both a therapist and an artist, working with diverse groups of individuals in a variety of settings. Her experiences contribute to an ever-expanding source of inspiration and modalities of creative expression.   Her work is a reflection of the relationships between line, form, function, and process and is often inspired by events and experiences in the community and environment.  By taking a single idea and bringing together related concepts and adding layers to it before de-constructing them into simple, minimalist terms, it allows the viewer (or in the case of jewelry, the wearer) to develop his or her own relationship with and meaning in her work. In her role as a therapist, Suga investigates and identifies patterns of movements and behaviors that may indicate if an individual has specific concerns in learning and function, and works to develop effective strategies to facilitate learning opportunities and comprehensive skill building. Similarly, through her art, she contemplates patterns of issues and concerns impacting our communities, and hopes to inspire the viewer to contemplate them as well through visual representation. While teaching and interacting with other artists, Suga’s interests have expanded to explore the application of techniques used in one medium into other media.  She is currently a faculty member at the Craft Alliance Center of Art + Design in Saint Louis in both metals and glass, where she has taught for over ten years. Suga exhibits her work in metals and glass both in the Saint Louis region and nationally, and her work is in museums and private collections. Her work “Image Re:In Chess” is currently in the exhibition The Imagery of Chess St Louis at World Chess Hall of Fame in St Louis through September 24, 2017.
