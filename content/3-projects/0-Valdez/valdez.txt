Acting as a catalyst, our past subconsciously influences our internal reply to current social relationships. While we continuously evolve interpersonally through various stages of life, so does our process of adapting. My work is an abstracted manifestation of how I choose to control interaction within various social spaces. The dialogue Ive established translates moments of emotional inflictions accumulated through past experiences. The specific manipulation of materials emphasize my willingness to interact, control, and be vulnerable.
