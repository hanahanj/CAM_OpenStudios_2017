In one series of photographs images of St Louis architecture in decay are contrasted with progressive contemporary architecture of major European cities including Paris, Basel and Strasbourg. Comparisons of color, texture, composition and formal elements create a dialogue between the images in diptych format. Another series of photographs explores the complexities of building construction at large scale St Louis building project sites. Still life images complete the current photographic portfolio. The vocabulary of images developed in the photographic portfolio are transformed in a variety of traditional and newer printmaking media and techniques including woodcut, collagraphy, monoprint, pronto print and chine collé.
