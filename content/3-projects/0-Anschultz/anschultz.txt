In the 20 years of his practice, Brandon Anschultz has made work mostly investigating the space between painting, sculpture and installation. He has focused on the materiality of painting and objects and has often employed loose narratives as a guide. Anschultz is at the beginning of a new body of work that will focus more narrowly on themes of queer identity and history.
