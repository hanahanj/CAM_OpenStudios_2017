Damia Smith creates mixed media artwork which allows the participant to come to a new level of understanding. The work can stand alone as a sculptural object but is not complete until someone touches and experiences it. The audience is an integral component in the work by physically manipulating it. All of the work involves a physical relationship between the viewer/wearer/ participant and a specific object or piece of artwork. She is interested in human interactions and their relationships with other humans and objects. Both art and performances can convey ideas and emotions; She wants to use these forms of communication to help people become more aware of their own feelings, attitudes and surroundings. Her work reinforces the importance of art as a social agent by allowing the viewers to see themselves inside of the artwork.
