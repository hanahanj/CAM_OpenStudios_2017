Much of my work is centered on creating healing art based on research in hospital design referred to as Evidence Based Design Art. This is largely comprised of images of nature in various forms that have been shown to reduce patient stays in hospitals as well as reducing the meds they take & staff stress. Also quite appropriate for senior living centers.
