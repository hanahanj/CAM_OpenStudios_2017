My work is produced in many series, such as Eye of the World which I have submitted images for the Contemporary Museum open studios. Other series which will be displayed in my studio include Circle Logic, Brick Memories, Ribbon Series, Abstract Lilies, and Leaves Alive, to mention a few. My paintings - wood panels, stretched canvas & watercolor paper - utilize bold colors to present abstract images. I am inspired by a variety of artists including Dove, Diebenkorn. De Kooning, Gorky, Guston, and Joan Mitchell, to name a few.
