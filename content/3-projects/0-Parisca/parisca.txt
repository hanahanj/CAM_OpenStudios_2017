My life and my work are an anthropological experiment; I am both observer and participant. I moved from
 Caracas, Venezuela to Toledo, Ohio in the year 2000. My family lives scattered across three continents. I know I
am not the only one. I am interested in identity as the permeability of our boundaries. I study the way we fill up
the social spaces given to us, the way we come to our borders, both literally and poetically. The moments where
internal worlds materialize, and habitus-as the way the outside world lives inside you everyday and resurfaces,
are common concepts in my work. In material terms, subjectivity comes to the surface and objectivity lies on
the surface. Photographs are flat slivers of reality, I play with our tendency to call that truth. Interdisciplinarity
 is both medium and concept. Embodiment is my process; my way of knowing and understanding. The work
is the artifact and residue of embodied experience in which material is substance. I aim to trace attention and
intention, to reveal sight as longing, sight as power, sight as control. I seek the difference between presentation
and representation. Your understanding of the word representation following the word presentation. The understanding
of my self as “estoy” lost in english and becoming always “yo soy.” I see truth in contextuality, multiplicity,
and contingency. I find beauty futility, fragility, and impermanence, and use this to push back on our technological
systems of identifying merit.
