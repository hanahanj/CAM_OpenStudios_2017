Through my art I empower people undefined by gender who are female on the inside and or the outside to express and celebrate their uniqueness and feel strong and beautiful. I live and work in my warehouse in Midtown. I start my art with my idea for an oil painting, then use the image in my clothing line, Sunday Jones Clothing. I have designed all the items in my clothing line and continue to add new items all the time. The original paintings and the clothes are all available for sale on my website.
