Norleen Nosri was born and raised in Malaysia. She came to the United States in 1997 for a higher education. She received a BFA (2010) and MFA (2013) in Ceramics at the University of Missouri-Columbia under the tutelage of Bede Clarke. During her undergraduate year, she took a job as a pottery instructor to children and advanced to teaching adult classes. Later, she began leading demonstrations and workshops for local elementary and high schools as well as programs for special needs children and adults. She transitioned to teach college level classes during and after her graduate program. While teaching she has worked consistently in the studio to develop her aesthetic voice. Keeping active with peers, developing her skills and participating in juried shows, her work has been featured in exhibitions in galleries and museums in Washington, Texas, Illinois, Kansas and Missouri. Her interest in the material and people has pushed her work into public art. She was awarded public art commissions by the City of Columbia, Missouri in 2013 and Emerson (for the Florissant/Ferguson School District, Missouri) in 2015. Her public artwork titled CommuniTea involves the public to participate in tea ceremonies. She was the artist-in-residence at the Missouri State Fair Fine Arts (2014), Ferguson/Florissant, MO School District (2015) and Craft Alliance Center of Art & Design, St. Louis (2014-15). Nosri continues to teach, work as a studio artist, and is involved in the local arts community.
