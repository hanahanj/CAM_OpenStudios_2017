My artwork is an extension of my inner thought processes and perceptions of the world around me. I have a very strong desire to convey the beauty and spirituality of the natural world, painting mainly in acrylics and adding some mixed media to the work. Using bright colors and energetic line movement I paint with passion and precision. Each piece is unique and speaks for itself. The subject matter varies, and it usually tells a story. I want to keep exploring and growing with art, making the world a better place. My inspirations are varied: nature, animals, music, cocktail art, beauty, color, trees, dreams, spirituality and art history. Having to feel connected and passionate when creating, I gather ideas for new artworks going about my daily life. Sketching it out, recycling ideas from past artworks, it becomes another project, opening the door for new creativity.
