My work is about American Identity as an Asian American. I'm interested in the customs, traditions, and aesthetics found throughout the country, specifically in small towns, rural areas, and farmlands, where national decorum is essential. As an Asian American I see American nationalism as a barrier to the freedom of expression it was meant to defend. Icons like flannel print, denim, corn, and hunting trophies are accessories to this national identity that are both compelling and inaccessible to American born minorities. The aim of my work is to strip these objects of their mythos and build a library of iconography that can be accessed and repurposed by any American.
