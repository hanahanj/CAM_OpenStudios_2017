How do you love and yet let go?  For me, this question pertains to younger versions of ourselves, to those who have passed or to things simply slipping away. As an act of love, I copy life. As an act of relinquishment - my forms de-materialize. As an act of commemoration, they look inward  The moments where the work departs from realism are moments of the spirit - of mercy, tenderness, fear and hope. 



Steeped in mold making and moments of realism, this work questions a basic premise of art, and that is the goal of copying nature. When artists copy nature, it rarely lives up to nature itself. What is the artist seeking that informs the act of copying/responding to life? How can that be reached and presented in the work? Again, the moments of abstraction in relation to life most capture my imagination.
