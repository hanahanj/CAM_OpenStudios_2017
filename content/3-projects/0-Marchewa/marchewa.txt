###Painting, Mixed Media



In the past years my work has been based in contrasts. I build worlds filled in allegory with the contrast of fantasy versus reality as the main theme.



 My work is also about the process, I use a variety of unexpected materials to build these worlds. Beside paint you can find anything from handmade figures, cosmetics, human hair, liquid within liquid, dirt, resin, etc. Surprises subtly hidden and trapped in time.



 From an early age my work has been included in many underground groups and venues including The 6th Floor Gallery, The Society for the Prevention of Academic Art, The Way Out, 1227 Gallery, Art-o-Mat Vending, and 20th Century Books and Ephemera. 



I have had many group and solo exhibitions, including Elliot Smith Contemporary Art, 456 Gallery NYC, Bruno David Gallery, Boots Contemporary Art Space, The Isolation Room, Hoffman LaChance, and the Luminary Center for the Arts. My work is included in many local, national, and international private art collections. Articles and reviews of my work have appeared in publications such as the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch, The Riverfront Times, Static, Inc., The Saint Louis Beacon, The West End Word, and 15 Minutes Magazine.
