As an observer I am fascinated by connections and relationships. As an artist, I am drawn to objects and forms that transcend space and time and derive instead from our collective subconscious.Often representative of archaic, modern or imagined ceremony, my work is inspired by rituals, ceremonies, commemorative objects and the civilizations that produced them. These themes are reinforced by my insatiable interest in the magic and mystery of ceremony, ritual and myth.
