Vaughn Davis is an artist and recent undergraduate of Webster University’s Department of Art Design and Art History. His interest in fashion, capitalism and himself influence his practice. “Serious Play” is of the utmost importance to Vaughn when creating, this is what lends his work to a wide range. In the north his tattered canvases in bright hues expand the definition of painting while dwelling in the south are many other practices including mixed media photographs and sculpture. Vaughn has exhibited widely in St. Louis and internationally while still able to recognize himself in the mirror.
