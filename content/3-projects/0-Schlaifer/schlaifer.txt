Schlaifer’s hybrid practice of poetry and sculpture is deeply invested in language as a material and material as language. Her collaborative installations combine text, sound elements, and sourced objects to create immersive environments based on her poems. Obsessed with the idea of accumulation—and even obsessiveness itself—she works with domestic materials like sugar, soap, and pickling salt, a substance which both preserves and corrodes, to create an often repellant beauty. She is drawn to these materials’ unpredictability and impermanence. Schlaifer is the author of Cleavemark (BOAAT Press, 2016) and her work has appeared in Best New Poets 2015, Harvard Review, AGNI, The Offing, LIT, Colorado Review, Fence, and Georgia Review, which nominated her for a Pushcart Prize. She frequently works with other artists, and her recent collaborations include the illustrated chapbook Strangers with a Lifeboat, with Jeff Pike, and the installation Cleavemark Dr with Cheryl Wassenaar. Schlaifer is currently working on a series of sculpture based on Cleavemark, and an additional installation and video series based on her new manuscript of poems, which investigates the bureaucracy of the brain.
