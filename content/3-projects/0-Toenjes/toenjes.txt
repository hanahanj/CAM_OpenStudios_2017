I started doing ceramics in 1998 and found I loved it but was craving to create more than decorative items so in about 2012 I expanded to Mosaics and found I enjoyed that too. With an appetite for more, I stumbled on a You Tube video of a unique and fresh process that instantly connected with my long time desire to do abstract painting. I had the drive but lacked the knowledge. There it was! The inspiring marriage of clay and paint...CLAY MONOPRINTING!! Since my exposure to the process I have submersed myself in the process and truly love creating Clay Monoprints.
