I create this work to make the world a little less lonely, to make us feel seen. My main mediums are paper + emotions. You can find me stitching, printing and folding and embroidering paper all about feelings, making weird drawings, writing love letters and manifests and zines about surviving and thriving. This work centers around the body, presence, stillness and identity.
