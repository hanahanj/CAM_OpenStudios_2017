###**Media Type:**
###Printmaking, Painting



I work mainly in the mediums of printmaking and painting, usually focusing on formal aesthetic concerns. Whether I am working objectively or non-objectively, I am most interested in controlling the visual relationships between shapes while directing light and shadow through various marks, textures, and colors. The goal is always to create an interesting image. Then if a context exists for the piece, I layer it on top of the compositional structure.
