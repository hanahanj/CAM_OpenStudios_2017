In January of 2016 myself and two friends Brittany Boynton and Julie Rechtien (@Butt'n Booty) established Grease Three as a store front, VHS library, studio space and gallery which has been host to a variety of art shows and events. Grease Three is an exciting project that hopes to bridge the gap between art and life by providing an accessible space to view art while also having fun!



 Over the past year my studio practice has produced a wide range of painting/sculpture with my main goal being to surprise myself with new combinations of material and fresh compositions. I like to use the traditional material/process of stretched canvas to play as a bounded surface to contain my non-traditional process/materials. I believe artistic freedom is more important than personal style meaning my paintings can change quick and often. Above all I hope my work can elicit happiness and inspire curiousness.
