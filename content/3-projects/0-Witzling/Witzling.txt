Mark’s inspiration is truly multilayered. Technically, he is inspired to challenge himself artistically, whether melding together warm and cool layers of color, focusing on a limited palette, or discovering new ways to use shape and line. Intellectually, he is inspired by intangible themes – subjects that don’t appear realistic, but may remind the audience of somewhere they’ve been or something they’ve experienced. Using a range of tools, from pastry knives to old credit cards, Mark applies layers of oil and malleable cold wax to his paintings, building them up and working them back down to bring forth a contrast of colors and textures to symbolize the complex dichotomy of our memories. Those memories which thrust themselves forward and those that fade into the background. Mark’s work has touched a variety of audiences. His award winning abstract oil and cold wax paintings have been presented in galleries, shows and private collections from the Midwest to New York, Berlin, and Mumbai, and adorns the walls of organizations, homes and businesses. Mark is a member of the Greater St Louis Art Association, St Louis Artist Guild, and Art St Louis, and past board member of MySLART.
