Raised in a Greek Orthodox, Biblical research fellowship ministry, Jewish family, Gina Grafos makes works which explore belief systems and semiotics. Based in the City of St Louis, she holds a role within the art community as an artist, educator, and curator and is committed to expanding those roles. As a teacher, portfolio reviewer, and speaker her goal is to inspire and mobilize individuals or groups, sharing the power of art as a conduit to nurture and heal. Over the past ten years teaching photography at Washington University in St Louis, Grafos has been a delegate for the "Race and Ethnicity" dialogue for diversity initiative, served on the Visiting Artist Selection Committee and a was a panelist at the Skandalaris Center. During her Cité Residency in Paris, she documented the unrest and current crises in Europe. RAC chose Grafos along with five remarkable local artists to partner with CET and CIC STL for an Artist Fellowship collaborative program in efforts to expand the dialog between those involved in startup technology, entrepreneurship, life sciences, and the arts. She is also the 2017 Artist in Residence at TechShop STL.
