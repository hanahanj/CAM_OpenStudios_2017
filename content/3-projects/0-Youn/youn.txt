My work deconstructs expectations and consequences of material behavior. I desire to queer the static and fixed relationships we have to our possessions and environments in order to destabilize expectations of function and power. With the distrust of fixed distinctions of “authentic” versus “artifice,” the work points to the fluid, unstable nature of identity and culture. Utilizing sculpture and video, I construct and perform Sisyphean situations that are doomed to fail in order to convey a sense of estrangement with one’s self and surrounding environment. 

In my newest work, I complicate the pastiche imitation of Western culturally loaded icons, such as marble and Greek columns, and how they are used as a superficial way to indicate value and power. I recreate these symbols with nonstructural material in order to subvert their symbolic power. I queer the stability and function of these objects through the lens of an identity existing in the gray area between cultures, nations and genders, presenting the simple notion that looks can be deceiving.
