A 501(c)3 social enterprise, Perennial is a community workshop and that offers educational programming in creative reuse to diverse populations and sells handmade DIY kits and tools for reuse projects. We turn trash in to amazing items and teach the community to do the same!Established in 2011, Perennial is a non-profit dedicated to creative reuse—the process of artistically transforming discarded goods into objects of worth. The concept for Perennial developed from the work of community artist and educator Jenny Murphy after creating numerous projects and programs leading diverse populations through the process of creative reuse. With the help of a passionate grassroots board, Perennial was established as a resource for the St Louis community to discover ways to reuse objects, reduce waste, and live a sustainable and self-sufficient lifestyle through the power of their personal creativity. In its workshop, Perennial teaches creative classes covering topics from eco-refinishing, to upholstery, to building new furniture from pallets. Perennial offers these educational programs to the public and partners with area social service agencies to engage women in transition in outreach programs. Perennial’s space also serves as a retail outlet for Perennial merchandise, the revenue from which supports the organization’s educational programs.
