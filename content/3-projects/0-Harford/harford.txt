My studio practice questions the concept of security by manipulating the uniformity of mass-produced objects from our everyday realm. These specific objects serve two proposes in my work: one, they have a universal appearance because of their reproduction, which can be altered to affect the viewer’s trust in reality; two, they often serve as a substitute for the body and can be implemented to create a visceral reaction to its irregularities. I am attracted to materials that can degrade from their purpose or be discarded for updated versions of themselves. These qualities become devices working inside of a new narrative that anticipates the loss of identity and self-deprivation in order to recognize what we dread. It is inside society’s incongruity that we can unveil what defines us most.
