I do surrealistic fantasies in pencil. My work is primarily black and white in nature, I have experimented with color but relate to the boldness of the black and white and shades of gray. Many times as I draw from an inspiration from nature other creatures appear and make themselves known in the composition by coming out of shadowed areas. I love drawing figures, people, animals and anything that evokes a reaction, an emotion.
