I'm a Mixed Media Jewelry and Fine Craft ArtiSt. My goal is to create truly distinctive wearable art designs that lift the spirits and inspire the soul. I create mixed media jewelry that combines my Original drawings, paintings, gemstones, artisan lampwork beads & fretwork in sterling silver, copper and brass along with other materials using cold connection methods. I use lighter weights in my materials so that my jewelry is comfortable to wear yet become stunning creations. Each of my main designs are "Retired" as soon as the piece "Finds a Great Home" so that only that person will own that special design. I also create many smaller lines such as creative bracelets, cuffs, hand fabricated wire earrings and hand painted leather pieces the accompany my main neckwear collection. From my detailed drawing of the piece to the hand fabricated one of a kind designs, I want to create truly unique pieces of wearable art for each of my collectors.
