I start with the everyday - the scribbles we make in cursive writing - enlarge, crop and layer them, and then place them in a new context. As in writing, these 'letters' still combine together and complete each other, but color and pictorial space replace grammar and syntax as the framework through which they are understood. I start with spare and simple elements and build them up into something visually rich, with depth, complex color, geometric tension, and resolution. 

In framing and enlarging these simple shapes and gestures, I am hoping that people will pause to give further consideration and find beauty in these once-tiny fragments of scribbles. At any rate, that's what I'm trying to get out of them. I also hope people will appreciate the confluence of gestures and mixing of colors on the page, and find some calm in the balance in the compositions. For me, these compositions are a respite from the hectic pace of the rest of my life, and they symbolize a clarity and resolution that I would like to think I'm moving toward.

Some of these prints I made myself and some are made with collaborator Amanda Verbeck of Pele Prints of St. Louis.
