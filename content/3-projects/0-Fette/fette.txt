###Printmaking



Nature is so inspirational. I enjoy printmaking because of the variety of techniques and how they can be combined so beautifully. My subjects vary greatly as does my style. When I see something beautiful, I am eager to depict it and share my perspective with others. Sometimes a beautiful subject needs to be spiced up. I like to experiment with texture and pattern sometimes from natural materials. Printmaking lends itself to layering and prints can take on a bas-relief quality that I find appealing. There is nothing as satisfying a pulling the print off of the plate because the outcome is always surprising and often delightful.
