The Adrift suite exposes the tension and isolation of modern relationships as an increasingly uncertain future leads to greater anxiety. Castaways float like jetsam upon a tarry slick, surviving while surrounded by literal and metaphorical pollution. Dinosaurs act as stand-ins for human players as a reference to humans’ reliance on fossil fuels and our outdated relationship dynamics. I attempt to practice what I preach; executing the series using recycled materials and less-toxic methods. The suite is a move toward self-exploration and sincerity, documenting the muddied future my partnership faces as we enter a new phase in our career and family.
