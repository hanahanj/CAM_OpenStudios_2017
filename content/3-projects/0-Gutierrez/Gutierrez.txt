Julius Gutierrez is originally a native of New York specializing in airbrush, acrylic paints, pencil sketching, and other mediums to create beautiful displays of art. With a huge passion for the comic-book genre, it's not hard to see the influence through many of his works. Walking into the studio you see huge portrait paintings covering the gallery walls from celebrity, political, and comic-book figures that reflect a realism on custom canvases made out of stitched synthetic leathers. He currently resides in St Louis, MO with his wife and kids and believes through art we can inspire the world.
