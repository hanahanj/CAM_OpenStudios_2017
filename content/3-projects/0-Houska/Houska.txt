Colorful, bold, intense art that commands attention and triggers a smile is the essence of artist Charles Houska’s work. He creates his own pop-art style, using a cast of characters, bright colors, and bordered “obsessively” by black lines. Houska constantly focuses his energies on creating new, bold, fun art to make people smile. His studio and gallery are located in the Central West End neighborhood of St Louis, MO, were he works as an independent artist. Though Houska’s art has been called “instantly gratifying” and “energizing” by art critics, Houska simply views his art as an escape from the gloom and doom of the real world. There is no hidden message, political or religious meaning. He paints for light-hearted, open-minded people of all ages.
