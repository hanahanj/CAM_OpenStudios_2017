It is located on a beautiful and serene six acres in north St Louis County.

Since opening in July 2013, Paul Artspace has hosted more than 60 local, national, and international artists, writers, and curators in various stages of their careers. Selected applicants are provided housing and studio space for a period of 1 to 3 months. Residents enjoy a private room, private studio space, communal kitchen and bath, and access to the tool room, wood shop, library, and etching press.
