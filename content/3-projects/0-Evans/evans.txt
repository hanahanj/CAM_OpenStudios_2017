###Ceramics, Drawing, Installation


My body of work includes ceramic object and vessels, drawings, wall sculpture, tiles, and public sited large-scale installations. The forms I make in clay, both single objects and installations usually derive from my drawings, which are a series of curvy lines and biomorphic shapes, repetitive marks and patterning; usually abstract and sometimes approaching the representational. Often there is an implied narrative. My work is informed by the things I love to look at and study--mostly natural objects, like birdâ€™s nest, flora, bodies of water and reflections there in, biology texts, and micro and macro images. I find seeing the underlying similarities in natural systems and objects, such as bifurcating branches of trees, rivers and the vein symptom, lead me to a feeling of reassurance and sometime awe. In addition to personal art making, I also enjoy sharing my ceramic passion teaching in area colleges and privately out of my studio in Webster Groves.
