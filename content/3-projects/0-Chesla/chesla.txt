Using aspects of order, repetition, stillness and evolution, I create works of unfocused awareness. Within these pieces, we experience manifestations of internal and external, cool and comforted, filtered and clarity of vision. We can find comfort in glacial speeds and spaces of great stillness. This work takes the viewer to that place of personal confrontation with beauty, stillness, isolation, and vast mindfulness. I focus this aesthetic perspective on creating sculptural objects, installation and drawings in order to bring the viewer to a stronger connection to this specific sense of presence.
