###Drawing, Sculpture



I aim to explore a post-apocalyptic world in ruin. My practice, taking the form of charcoal drawings and sculptures, balances both the will to survive in such circumstances and the vulnerability of the human body. I am influenced by spiritual experiences and particularly concerned with ideas of religious symbolism, ritual and cult.

I re-imagine a future world as a place whose inhabitants consist only of feral children and where Mother Nature is claiming back her own territory. If my imagery evokes an atmosphere of apocalypse, it also refers to a beginning of collective human history. Thus, if we perceive the idea of threat and an echo of images referring to archaic rituals of tribal populations, we can also approach it with an anthropological and positive eye and thus establish a link with a society that I make visible in the pictorial space of my work.

I utilize the charcoal’s unique abilities to capture expression with a fragile and quivering stroke of my hand. The totemic three-dimensional works reference a range of historical, cultural and visual objects, mixing styles from disparate places and periods.
