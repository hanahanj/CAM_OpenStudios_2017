Jacob Stanley is a sculptor who focuses on temporary site-responsive installations and loves to wear scarves and vests. His work is generated from informed intuition, design thinking and installed in improbable urban locations. His work exists in a state of dynamic stasis, which entreats viewers to question: is the work finished, has it just begun or is it a prank? These projects often subvert the original purpose of an industrial material to foster a dialogue that focuses on engaging a non-art audience.
