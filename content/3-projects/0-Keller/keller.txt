Surveillance Series: My constant use of a cell phone and laptop shows the seductive pervasiveness of digital technology in my life. Embracing the newest iPhone or the latest app, I capture, link and distribute what interests me.  Also a constant in my life is the network of surveillance in our country that means virtually everything I do digitally is no longer private. Digital cameras provide an endless loop of doubtful examination and ultimately reveal themselves as threats to freedom, civil liberty and identity privacy. On average, we are recorded 75 times per day, with constant surveillance targeting our email, phone calls, texting, online activities like personal finances, photographs, social media and business communications, and movements through location-tracking services. My art looks back at these cameras and shows the tangled, complex and hidden aspects of this intrusion. My installation, USofA Drone Carpet, is a patterned arrangement of 156 tiny drone sculptures arranged in the pattern of the American flag, but in colors of gray and white, as somber representations of the state as an instrument of surveillance. Using a wide range of different media, I focus on this secretive relationship between subject and spectator.
