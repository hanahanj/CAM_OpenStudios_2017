I am obsessed with the predicament of the human form, both its fragility and its dominance in the environment. My recent ceramic series investigates the body in a state of ambiguous metamorphosis. Irregular outgrowths in the material signal erratic germination or atrophy—a disfiguration of appendages. Where traditional figurative sculpture often captures a predictable motion in time and space, my work changes as the viewer moves around it. What happens on one side might be wholly unanticipated on the other. By working against symmetry, I challenge the expectations of wholeness for the body. Painting rather than glazing the ceramic allows me to more intuitively build a depth of dimension and color, radically experimenting with the experience of the object. Additionally, the forms are precarious—only a gesture or two away from collapse. Influenced by the particular uncertainty in contemporary culture, these strange bodily forms defy disambiguation. Their stilled and puzzled nature is a grasping for truth or a viable belief system.
