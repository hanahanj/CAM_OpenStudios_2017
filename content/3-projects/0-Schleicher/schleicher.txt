Nick Schleicher is a process painter whose work reflects a studio practice focused on exploring the physicality, presence, and application of paint. Currently, through experimentation with acrylic mediums, the artist creates acrylic paint “skins” which begin as paintings on plastic sheets. These skins are then peeled away from the sheet and collaged onto thin panels that float out from the wall. As the acrylic skins are applied to the surface of these panels, they are wrinkled, folded, stretched, etc. Imperfectly applied, the skins question the relationship of paint to surface and walk the line between painting and sculpture. Additionally, Schleicher indulges in the replication of mundane objects as painted sculptures, ranging from basketballs and VHS boxes to special edition beer cans at a 1:1 scale to the real objects. Upon further investigation, these mixed-media sculptures reveal the artists playful hand as well as all the imperfections of the mediums chosen to represent each object.
