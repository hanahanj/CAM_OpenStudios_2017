Founded in Fall of 2014, Film Base STL began in a small industrial bathroom, which was converted to a working darkroom space by Davey Rocco, Tim Merritt and Andrew Genova. Nearly two years to the day, Caroline Philippone joined the collective, and half a year later the group moved to their new space in the basement of their original building. Although each are unique in their shooting style and vision, all are connected through traditional film based work, and photograph with the intent to print on silver gelatin paper.
