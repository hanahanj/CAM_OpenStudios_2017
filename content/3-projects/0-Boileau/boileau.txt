Nanette E. Boileau (Ph.D. in Education and Art-based research, Saint Louis University, M.F.A., Pasadena Art Center College of Design) lives and works in St. Louis, Missouri. Boileau’s qualitative art-based dissertation, “Art creating Knowledge: ‘White Woman’ Producing Knowledge,” connects art, feminist and critical race theory, labor, and higher education with the production of a double projection digital video artwork entitled, “White Woman”. Boileau received her Bachelor of Fine Arts, 1988, from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, Texas and her Master in Fine Art from The Pasadena Art Center College of Design in 1994. Curating for ten years at Saint Louis University and opening the Museum of Art (SLUMA) for the University, Boileau developed exhibitions such as; Time Play: A 25 year retrospective of Van McElwee Video Art, Lampo Leong and Yueying Zhong; Suspended Marks, Jeff Carter; Things Move, Shirley Tse; Encapsulated, and Christina Shmigel, Betwixt and Between. Boileau has also been an exhibiting artist during the same period and is a Great Rivers Biennial Recipient for 2016. She has exhibited with Art Production Fund in the APF Lab, New York, New York, the centre of attention, London, England, The Bradbury Building, I-KLEC/TIC gallery and the South Bay Contemporary in Los Angeles, California. Locally Boileau has exhibited with Los Caminos, Contemporary Art Museum St. Louis, The Sheldon Art Galleries, Gallery 210, and The Museum of Transportation Museum in St. Louis, Missouri.
