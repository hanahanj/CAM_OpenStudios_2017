Maxine du Maine is a visual artist and filmmaker from St. Louis, Missouri, with two bachelor's degrees in both fields at Webster University. Maxine’s art reflects who she is and what has molded her into who she is. Born and raised on the “Delmar Divide” on the west side of St. Louis, Maxine du Maine’s work is a reflection of the variety of colorful experiences she had in her youth and her journey to self-acceptance and self-love as a black woman. 

Maxine's work is a visual representation of embracing her culture, identity and past and discovering a new love for herself through this journey. She often depicts the black woman in her natural state as she has grown to love her. 

Maxine has received awards and local acclaim for her art, films and commitment to art education and has been featured in many publications including the St. Louis Post Dispatch and AfroPunk. Maxine currently teaches visual art at Preclarus Mastery Academy and at the Juvenile Detention Center, through a collaboration with Craft Alliance; where she helps the students find direction and purpose and build their self-confidence through art.
