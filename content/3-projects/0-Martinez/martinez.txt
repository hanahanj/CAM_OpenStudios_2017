In our culture, there exists a myth about messy people that instead of being disorganized and generally sloppy, they’re actually in touch with their creativity.

And isn’t that true?

As kids, we made messes: boxes of crayons scattered on the floor, toys dominating the living roomóthe world was our playground, all we had to do was create. But somewhere along the way, we got told to pick up and organize. Over time, we realized messes were bad. But for real creative magic to happen, you have to allow an explosion of materials, thoughts, and colors. You have to make a mess.

Making messes is where pure creation is born. Being messy silences the inner critic that says we need to be clean, and perfect, and orderly. An unplanned yet elaborate messy process begins with the first stroke on a blank surface there is experimentation and problem solving, adding and subtracting, and a total immersion into the physical act of painting. Although my intent is non-objective, shapes and other marks may suggest references to the natural world. To me, a successful painting is one that inspires each viewer to find his or her own connection.
