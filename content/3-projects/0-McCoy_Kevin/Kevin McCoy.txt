WORK/PLAY is an interdisciplinary design duo comprised of Kevin and Danielle McCoy. They integrate conceptual design, experimental printmaking techniques and textiles throughout their body of work. This is often done with typographic works, imagery and a variety of hand-dyed fabrics. The duo also incorporates bookmaking for publications, time-based works as well as installations to serve as a viable platform to disseminate an acerbic message to viewers. Their work centers around racial inequality as black Americans, erasure in history, and predisposed stereotypes often propagated by media.
