Jen Everett is an artist from Detroit, Michigan, currently living and working in Saint Louis, Missouri. She is interested in the tension between the consumption and control of images. Her work explores blues sensibility, blackness and most recently the archive. Over the past 2 years her work has evolved from a strictly photography based practice to one incorporating text and sculpture. Jen’s art making has been heavily influenced by her training in architecture and she often employs meticulous model making techniques to cut, sculpt and layer photographs and texts until they become almost unrecognizable, blurring the lines between photography and sculpture. Jen’s work has been shown locally and nationally at arts spaces including Vox Populi in Philadelphia and Gallery 102 in Washington DC. Her work has been published in Transition and SPOOK magazines. She has received support grants for her work from the Regional Arts Commission in Saint Louis, has been an artist in residence at the Vermont Studio Center and the Atlantic Center for the Arts.
