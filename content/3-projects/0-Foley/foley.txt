Foley's work is about language, subliminal messaging, and the alteration of words to become new words entirely. The phrases explore advertising culture, class systems, social stratification and gentrification, and the portrayal of ethnicities in news media. Foley also uses his creative output to explore connections between secular and religious spheres. Tate's work has been recently exhibited in New York City, Washington D.C., Portland, St. Louis, Cleveland, and purchased by Toledo Museum of Art, and the UCLA Fine Arts, Yale University, and Reed College libraries.
