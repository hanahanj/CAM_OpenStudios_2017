At age eight, Mark Swain would accompany his father to his job as groundskeeper for Forest Park, and sit for hours by the waterfall drawing. Today, he continues to interpret the world around him through various artistic media – music, floral design, jewelry making, painting, drawing, photography and sculpture – turning often to the human form for artistic inspiration. Indeed, the human form has been a life’s passion for Mark, who is a licensed cosmetologist, esthetician, national board certified massage therapist, and holistic health and massage therapy instructor.

Excited by photographers such as Skrebneski and Edward Curtis, and artists such as Michelangelo, Bernini, Hieronymus Bosch, Salvador Dali, Botticelli, and Rodin, Mark also knew that the emotion and experience of past generations are inherent in the seemingly unconscious entwining of cellular being, and readily express themselves through the artist’s hand when the artist has the sensitivity to touch that mystery within.

Of Native American descent, Mark walks “the Red Rd,” observing Native traditions and sacred ways. His intense love of the natural world, his fluency with mystical experiences, and his awareness that “everything is alive” lend depth, intensity, and anima to his pieces.
