Sole Survivor is the working studio & retail space for the leather work of Steve & Kay Rye and daughter, Annie Rye. Works created range from functional to the experimental. Visitors to the Maplewood space will be treated to an impressive display of hand tools and machinery as well as a view of the artists at work. Kay is currently working together with Steve making sculptural leather pots. The pots are made of a single piece of leather that is first soaked in water. Then, using hand tools, bone folders, old hat forms, and even an old porcelain doorknob, the leather is molded and shaped. The result is often a wild & unrestrained, yet stable, vessel providing the perfect backdrop for plants.
