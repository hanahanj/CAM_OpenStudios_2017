My work seeks to highlight the intricacies of nature and foster an understanding and appreciation for the unseen details and overarching systems that maintain the balance of the natural world. The same principles that govern artwork are prevalent in natural ecology. In the same way a composition is greater than the sum of its parts, the interactions between organisms and their environments create a system greater and more incomprehensible than its individual components. Line and color balance to produce dimension in a drawing, just as features of individual organisms complement their surroundings to create a balance of all life within an ecosystem. Thus, the dynamic relationships of the natural world lend themselves well to artistic representation and the artist is able to capture what the scientist’s empiricism describes: the fluid beauty and infinite intricacy of natural systems.
