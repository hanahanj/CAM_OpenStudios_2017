Ann Wimsatt begins her work with a journey, traveling to cities around the globe, where she makes small ink and watercolor paintings of each city's iconic public plazas and skylines. She then brings the works back to her studio for further scale and color investigations. Her compositions gain their unique emotional resonance through a nuanced layering of plein-air painting beneath a series of digital modulations. As the meaning and significance of cities is often hidden in generations of continual construction, likewise, the complexity of Wimsatt's final prints reflect the enduring resilience of the cities she represents, alongside a contemporary narrative about the physical process of making paintings.
