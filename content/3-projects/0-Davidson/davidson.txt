I am a rigorous observer of the natural world around me and my work is a direct response to that perception. I am fascinated by the infinite variations springing forth from nature. I love horizon lines, fault lines, any line demarcating the meeting point between two worlds. I am drawn to highly saturated colors, to water, and the interplay of light that illuminates and obscures forms. I often use gold leaf in my work, admiring the Renaissance masters who used it as a bridge for light and spirituality. I intend to visually seduce the viewer into my private world.

I am deeply curious as to my place in this larger Cosmos we call Life. I fasten on a thread or question and paint myself the answers. By being rigorously honest in my responses. I hope to pierce my singularity and visually appeal to a more universal audience. I most often work in series. I complete a series when I have answered these questions to my own, if not everyone’s satisfaction.

In the Serenity Series I attempt to bounce the light to the heavens, to seek clarity, to impose order over Chaos, painting threads of hope for a journey of transcendence.
