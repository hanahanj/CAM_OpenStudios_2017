Through a distinct and sharp wit, material economy and sensitivity, and a meticulous attention to craft, I aim to compose a defiant and accomplished body of work. The high standard of workmanship to which I adhere adds a layer of seriousness to my visual one-liners and stands as a rebellion against the systems that allow our "throwaway" lifestyle. To captivate a diverse audience my work functions on various levels; ranging from an emphasis on surface meaning and aesthetics, to deeper conceptual themes such as our society's "live to work" mentality and its related cultural and environmental effects. Furthermore, a dedicated studio practice - defined by a consistent and independent fastidiousness - proves the depth and seriousness of my creative pursuits.
