My work is a representation of the strength and beauty of cultures and people. The pieces I paint holds strong messages and display beautiful images on wildly colored water colors. My paintings is a manifestation of my dreams or how I see people. My aspirations for my work is to be noticed, appreciated and recognized world wide. For the future I hope for growth in my art and recognition for memorable powerful pieces.
