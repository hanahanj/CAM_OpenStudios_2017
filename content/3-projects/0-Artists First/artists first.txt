A cross section of the St Louis community with its diversity, artistic vibrancy and unique creative contributions, Artists First promotes an inclusive community resulting in enrichment for all despite physical, mental or cognitive disabilities.Our artists create artwork that is fresh and thoughtful, spontaneous and insightful, and like all serious artists, their work is self-directed and created from concept to completion. An important element of Artists First is fostering understanding, collaboration and true community integration of disenfranchised populations while promoting cultural and artistic enrichment in the community.
