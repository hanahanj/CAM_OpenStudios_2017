Lindsey Stouffer’s work includes sculptural objects, installation, furniture design, and public art. Her primary material is steel although the work incorporates a spectrum of materials. Themes in the work emerge from the pathos (as in experience) of place. "Place" is understood literally and metaphorically as a situation, relationship, or condition. Current work explores themes surrounding topophilia and displacement, relying on the expressive potential of simple geometric volumes.
